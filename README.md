Just another repositary
My name is chris shaw, I started learning to code approximately 12 months ago, I began with HTML & CSS and have become fairly proficient with both. My goal now is to move on to mastering javascript and some of its main frameworks like angular, react and node. Eventually I wish to be proficient in all aspects of computer programming & science.
